# CMPG-323-Overview-34938362
My CMPG 323 Project for 2022
## Reposirories
I'm Still decing of weather to have a reposetory per project or just one big reposetory. Once I see the other projects I will adjust accordingly.
## Branching stratagies
I will be using 3 branch types for completing my projects, namely: main, develop and feature.(See diagram provided illustrating implementation).
