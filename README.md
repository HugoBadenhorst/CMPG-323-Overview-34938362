# CMPG-323-Overview-34938362
My CMPG 323 Project for 2022
## Project Description
For project one, I have done everything in my ability to ease the start of the other projects. The groundwork has been laid. Once I start project 2 I'll adjust my planning (Kanban) as needed.
## Repositories
I'm Still deciding on whether to have a repository per project or just one big repository. Once I see the other projects I will adjust accordingly.
## Branching strategies
I will be using 3 branch types for completing my projects, namely: main, develop and feature. Develop will only branch off of Main and will be the only branch merged back into main ensuring a working pipeline at all times. Feature will branch off of Develop and will be the only way for adding new features to Develop(See diagram provided illustrating implementation).

## .gitignore
Specific files will be stated in the future but in general, any files containing configurations, Mabey editor specific or OS specific files, code linter files and any imported files to minimize file oplode and download size.
## Credentials
For credentials, I'll probably use a simple "git config --global credential.helper store" since I'm the only person that has access to my PC.
